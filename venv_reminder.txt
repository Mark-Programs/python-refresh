- Open VScode

- In the file manager, navigate to the project folder

- Drag and drop that folder into VS code

- Open the terminal (or run a "hello world" program)
	Should display, ex: user@lnxbox:~$

- In the terminal, type:
	python3 -m venv .venv

- .venv folder is created

- vs code should ask if you want to use the new environment, click yes
	> if it doesn't ask, in lower right status bar, can select it
		ie: Python 3.11.0 ('.venv': venv)
		
- Run the "hello world" again to open the terminal, and should see the prompt change
	If it doesn't, go into the terminal and type:
		$ . ./.venv/bin/activate
		
	This will activate the environment, with the prompt ex:
		(.venv) user@lnxbox:~........$
		
	And you can then:
		python --version
		pip install --upgrade pip
		pip install <packages>
		etc
		
		VS code should remember the environment settings when that workspace is opened.
